# MoreDotNet

The project has two main focuses:

- Create handy extension methods for common DotNet types like string, int, object, Color, Bitmap etc.
- Create easy to use and accurate extension methods for transliteration functionality (In progress)

The package is still under development and some bugs may exist.

To install via NuGet use:

```
Install-Package MoreDotNet
